//Arrays

/*
-Problem: There is a lot of DATA that exists!!!
-Managing each piece in its own variable is going to become impractical/borderline impossible.
-Alot is quite similiar or related, whether its by purpose or even data type

-We need to introduce means to store multiplepieces of data within one device/variable.

-Arrays offer a way for us to very simply store multiple values of the same data type

-Syntax:
    DataType[] variableName = new DataType[size];

*/

//Basic Example 
int[] numbers = new int[5]; //this is NOT an integer, it is an Array with Integers
