        We use an interface because the Dependency Injection (DI) container prefers having the most generic version of the dependency to work with.
        The DI container will look for any instances of this interface and use the provided implementation to inject it where it is needed.

        An interface is a contract for a class. It lays out the required methods that any class must implement if it chooses to use the interface.
