Project  Proposal looks good. I would say you can reduce/remove admin needs for now. Focus on one role, users. 
Focus on just deposit, withdraw, etc. The properties you have listed are a bit perplexing. 
What I might consider for the scope of this project....is just store a balance. 
If you wanted to track all deposits and withdrawals, it'd make sense to log into a Transaction Table (aka another Model), but you could just not for this project.

To those last questions I’d say yes. (loops for more transactions)
But balance is a state. Deposit and withdraw are an action. So they are just methods that modify the current balance to a new value. 
You should loop it long term to ask them if they’d like to perform another transaction. 
And you should have multiple Users. Just not user types.
